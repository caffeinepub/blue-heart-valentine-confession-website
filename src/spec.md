# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the large central glowing blue heart image from the Proposal and Transition pages, and add a “Finally” button on the Gifts Hub to navigate to the final page.

**Planned changes:**
- On the Proposal page ("/"), stop rendering the large central glowing blue heart image while keeping existing layout, spacing, theme, and Yes/No interactions unchanged.
- On the Transition page ("/yay"), stop rendering the large glowing blue heart image while keeping the existing centered heading/subtitle and ~2 second auto-navigation to "/gifts" unchanged.
- On the Gifts Hub page ("/gifts"), add a bottom-of-page button labeled “Finally” that navigates to "/forever", using existing button styling and remaining usable on mobile.

**User-visible outcome:** The first two pages no longer show the large heart image, and the Gifts page includes a “Finally” button that takes the user to the "/forever" page.
